# UNET-SSTBM
MATLAB computer codes for surrogate modeling using U-Net architecture combined with a geostatistical spectral algorithm for transient groundwater flow inverse problems

Preliminary versions of the code. In development to make them user-friendly.

Requirement:
1) The MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST) version 2020a. MRST is a free open-source software for reservoir modeling and simulation. Can be found at: https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/download/
2) Matlab toolbox - Deep Network Designer
